fabonacci sequence:
n=int(input("enter no. of terms for printing fabonacci series:"))
n1,n2=0,1
count=0
if (n<=0):
    print("enter valid positive num")
elif (n==1):
    print("fabonacci sequence upto",n,":")
    print(n1)
else:
    print("fabonacci sequence :")
    while(count<n):
        print(n1)
        nth=n1+n2
        n1=n2
        n2=nth
        count+=1

output:
fabonacci sequence :
0
1

display count of digits in a number using for loop
n=int(input())
count=0
for i in str(n):
    n//=10
    count+=1
print(count)

What are the pass,break and loop statements
Break statement: 
As the name suggests, break the loop and moves the program to control the block of code after the loop (if nay).
Pass statement:
This statement is used to do nothibg 2 of its uses are:exception catchiing and if elif chain
Continue statement:
This statement is opposite of break statement and is used to force the next iteration of the loop.

program for factorial:
n=int(input())
fact=1
for i in range(1,n+1):
    fact=fact*i
print(fact)
